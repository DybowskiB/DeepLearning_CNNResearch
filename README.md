# CNN Research on CINIC-10 Dataset

This repository contains experiments and research focused on deep learning models trained on the [CINIC-10](https://github.com/BayesWatch/cinic-10) dataset.

## Project Scope

- **Baseline CNN** — standard convolutional neural network trained from scratch.
- **Ensemble Learning** — combination of multiple CNN models to boost performance.
- **Prototypical Networks** — few-shot learning approach applied to image classification.
